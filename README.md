- 👋 Hi, I’m Francisco Delgado (@fdelgadosv)
- 👀 I’m interested in implementing applications to make Earth Observation data available to decision makers in developing regions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving a wide range of technologies and tools (Web Mapping Services, cloud and on-premise infrastructure services, AI/ML, UI/UX, Databases, Web & Mobile development... anything that's required to deliver EO data to various types of researchers and decision makers).
- 📫 You can reach me at franciscodelgado503@gmail.com
